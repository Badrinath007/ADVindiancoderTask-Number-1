            <h3>Enhancement of UWB Patch Antenna using Metamaterial for MIMO System </h3>
            <p class="intro">Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has gained significant attention in recent
                years due to its numerous advantages over traditional narrowband systems,
                including high data rates, low power consumption, and robustness to interference.
                Microstrip antennas are widely used in UWB applications due to their compact
                size, ease of integration, and broad bandwidth.</p>
                <p class="intro1">
                Metamaterial-based antenna designs have shown potential in improving the
                performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. These designs
                use structures that can manipulate electromagnetic waves, resulting in improved
                bandwidth, gain, and isolation between antenna elements. Designs have
                demonstrated improved performance compared to traditional antennas, making
                them suitable for use in MIMO systems operating in various frequency bands.<a href="project.html">Read more>></a></p>

            <h3 class="nr">Channel Optimization for 5g NR</h3>
            <p class="intro2">In the growing wireless communication systems of 5G, FBMC is one the of the dominant contenders
                and the final successor of 5G which is 5G NR (New Radio) a flexible and standalone version of 5G. After the
                implementation of Multiple Access techniques, most of the situations the performance of the system doesn’t
                rely completely on the transmitter and receiver but also depends on the channel whose performance can be
                improved by increasing SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) & decreasing the BER (Bit Error Rate).

                monthly or yearly expenses. The expenses and earnings are maintained in a simple
                and intuitive way thus making the user to access the required categories easily
