            <h3>Enhancement of UWB Patch Antenna using Metamaterial for MIMO System </h3>
            <p class="intro">Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has gained significant attention in recent
                years due to its numerous advantages over traditional narrowband systems,
                including high data rates, low power consumption, and robustness to interference.
                Microstrip antennas are widely used in UWB applications due to their compact
                size, ease of integration, and broad bandwidth.
            </p>
            <p class="intro1">
                Metamaterial-based antenna designs have shown potential in improving the
                performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. These designs
                use structures that can manipulate electromagnetic waves, resulting in improved
                bandwidth, gain, and isolation between antenna elements. Designs have
                demonstrated improved performance compared to traditional antennas, making
                them suitable for use in MIMO systems operating in various frequency bands.
            </p>
            <p class="intro1_1">
                    Microstrip antennas are widely used in modern wireless communication systems
                    due to their low profile, lightweight, and ease of integration with microwave
                    circuits. A microstrip antenna consists of a thin metallic patch printed on a
                    dielectric substrate and fed by a coaxial cable or a microstrip line. Microstrip
                    antennas have several advantages over traditional antennas, such as
                    omnidirectional radiation pattern, low cost, and conformal nature. However,
                    microstrip antennas also suffer from several challenges, such as narrow
                    bandwidth, low gain, and low radiation efficiency.
            </p>
            <p class="intro1_2">
                    To overcome these challenges, researchers have explored the use of ultra-
                    wideband (UWB) technology in microstrip antenna designs. UWB technology
                    allows for the transmission of signals with very large bandwidths, typically
                    greater than 500 MHz or 20% of the center frequency. UWB signals have several
                    advantages over narrowband signals, such as increased data rate, improved
                    signal-to-noise ratio, and reduced interference. UWB technology has applications
                    in various fields, such as wireless sensor networks, radar systems, and high-speed
                    data transmission. The combination of microstrip antennas and UWB technology
                    has led to the development of UWB microstrip antennas, which have several
                    advantages over traditional microstrip antennas. UWB microstrip antennas have
                    larger bandwidth, higher gain, and improved radiation efficiency, making them
                    suitable for use in various applications, such as communication systems, medical
                    imaging, and environmental sensing.

            <p class="intro1_3"><!--<img src="images/hfss.png" class="hfss">-->
                    H-slotting is a technique used to modify the performance of microstrip patch
                    antennas by introducing a narrow slot in the shape of an "H" in the radiating patch
                    element. This slot modifies the electromagnetic field distribution on the patch,
                    leading to changes in the antenna's radiation characteristics.
            </p>
            <p class="intro1_4"><!--<img src="images/hfss1.png">-->
                    One advantage of using H-slotting in microstrip patch antennas is that it can
                    improve the impedance bandwidth and reduce the cross-polarization levels. This makes the antenna more suitable for use in wireless communication systems that
                    require high data rates and reliable performance.
            </p>
            <p class="intro1_5">
                    In conclusion, our new proposed design metamaterial-based antenna design for
                    MIMO system applications, which used a complementary split-ring resonator
                    (CSRR) structure to improve the antenna performance. The proposed antenna
                    design was based on a monopole antenna placed in close proximity to another
                    monopole antenna on a dielectric substrate. The CSRR structure was integrated
                    into the ground plane of the antenna to reduce mutual coupling and enhance the
                    antenna's performance.
            </p>
            <p class="intro1_6">
                    The bandwidth of the proposed antenna is about 7.2 GHz and radiation efficiency
                    is 79%. The radiated power at 7.8 GHz frequency is 0.948 watts and peak
                    directivity is 1.021.

            <h3 class="nr">Channel Optimization for 5g NR</h3>
            <p class="intro2">In the growing wireless communication systems of 5G, FBMC is one the of the dominant contenders
                and the final successor of 5G which is 5G NR (New Radio) a flexible and standalone version of 5G. After the
                implementation of Multiple Access techniques, most of the situations the performance of the system doesn’t
                rely completely on the transmitter and receiver but also depends on the channel whose performance can be
                improved by increasing SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) & decreasing the BER (Bit Error Rate).
            </p>
            <p class="intro2_1">
                    Channel,Transmitter & Receiver altogether give rise to a better performing communication system. In this project we
                    worked on improving channel and propose a channel with lesser bit error and high data rates which are the
                    basic requirements of a robust channel. We have worked with the following parameters, Subcarrier Spacing,
                    Carrier Frequency, No. of Subcarriers, Overlapping Factors and Hermite coefficients.
            </p>
            <p class="intro2_2">
                    In today’s era of wireless communication, users demand high speed and low latency network. To fulfill
                    the demands of the subscribers, FBMC-OQAM modulation technique has been used and this give rise to 5g
                    wireless communication. FBMC-OQAM has been taken into consideration to implement and to get good data
                    rates as compared to 4G. In 4G, OFDM technique has been used as the modulation technique to increase the
                    data rates and reduce the latency with efficient bandwidth usage.
            </p>
            <p class="intro2_3">
                    In OFDM, CP (Cyclic prefix) has been used to prevent loss of data that is transmitted. The poor spectral
                    properties of OFDM are one of its biggest disadvantages so that we have switched to FBMC with OQAM, in
                    short just FBMC, has lower out-of-band emissions than OFDM. 5G NR (New Radio) is a new technology
                    which has been developed by 3GPP (3 rd Group Partnership Project) from 5G to improve its efficiency when
                    compared with 4G. 5G NR is a successor of 5G with the following features, Stand Alone – Unlike 5G, which
                    has a backward compatibility to almost all 4G devices, 5G NR which only supports devices that are created
                    specifically for 5G. It’s expected to have lower cost, better efficiency, and to assist development of new use
                    cases as the old protocols for 4G will be dropped for good. Improved Spectral Efficiency – With 4G out of
                    the equation, 5G spectrum can completely utilize its spectrum only for 5G rather than multiplexing it with 4G
                    LTE spectrum. Increased number of Subcarrier Spacing – 5G NR supports 5 subcarrier frequencies [15KHz,
                    30KHz, 60KHz, 120KHz & 240KHz], whereas 5G uses the same subcarrier spacing (15KHz) as 4G LTE for
                    backward compatibility.
            </p>
            <p class="intro2_4">
                    FBMC is implemented in 5G, which is as type of modulation that uses Filter Bank with Multi Carriers
                    to modulate data and it has been developed from ODFM. In FBMC, Cyclic Prefix are replaced by Filter Bank.
                    Filter Bank is an array of bandpass filters that splits the input signal into multiple components, each one
                    carrying a single frequency sub-band of the message signal. These sub-bands are obtained by applying FFT
                    to the oversampled message signal. These filter banks are distributed in frequency domain, which is more
                    likely the same as in OFDM.
            </p>
            <p class="intro2_5">
                    FBMC is a modified technique of OFDM to control the impacts of ISI which is one of the great
                    challenges in the wireless communication system. The efficiency of the system relies on the ideas implied for
                    BER reduction. From our experimentation all this time we say that, for 30KHz subcarrier spacing with new
                    Hermite coefficients, overlapping factor, number of subcarriers and by increasing carrier frequency from
                    2.4GHz to 4.2GHz gives better error reduction which gives rise to higher data rates when implemented and implemented which is simulated and inferred
                    using MATLAB. Thus, with the subcarrier spacing as 30KHz, FBMC channel provides a stronger SNR and
                    lower BER compared to that of the existing work. Also importing some features of 5G NR, increased compatibility and higher data rates
                    can be achieved.
